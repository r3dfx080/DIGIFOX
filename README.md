# Designed by specialist for specialists

This is my personal app, created specifically for tracking and managing orders for digitization. Only essential modules, no overengineering involved! 

# Intuitive UI

**No distractions! Only essentials!**
UI is built solely on the concept of creating an order for a new customer as fast as possible:

 - Most of UI elements are centered so you spend less time dragging cursor across the screen
 - One-screen creation of order (your cursor stays at the center of the screen)
 - Settings facet is used to store your custom column orders and sorting settings (multi sorting is enabled by default!)
 - Easy to interpret badges are used for differentiation between complete and incomplete orders
 - Profile links are embedded into orders list so you can jump straight to a conversation with a customer from order list

A notification on log in provides you with useful information 

# Technical data and service information collection and management

DigFox provides you a set of tools to track your active VCR heads wear and time past cleaning (only one active VCR is supported at the moment).  All expenses (advertising, equipment purchases, etc.) are used for calculation of the net profit. 

# Extensive statistics and metrics
Statistics from all orders is used to give you the best experience. Easy to read donut diagram shows percentage of each media type you've ever went through, hour price (derived from net profit) is calculated so you can adjust your pricing policies accordingly.
